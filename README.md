### Homework package for BTRY 6520 (Pending bug fix)
This is the package that integrates the result form hw1 of BTRY6520.

To try it out, use the code below

```r
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github('xw547/hwpkg')
```

However, the browseVignettes() will only work if this the package is built and saved as .tar.gz file. But you can always my vignette file under the /vignette directory. Please feel free to contact me if you prefer using the browseVignettes() function.

Sorry, this package haven't finish yet, since I found several critial mistakes when checking. I'll done by this weekend. Thank you for waiting.
